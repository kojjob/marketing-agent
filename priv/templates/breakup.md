Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{company}} with RTB optimization, but I haven't heard back.

I don't want to keep bothering you, so this will be my last email. If RTB performance ever becomes a priority, feel free to reach out — I'm always happy to chat.

Wishing you and {{company}} all the best.

[Your Name]
